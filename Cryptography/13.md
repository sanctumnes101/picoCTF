## Description

## Hints

> This can be solved online if you don't want to do it by hand!


## Approach & Solution

Ok so we know the the flag is encrypted using `ROT-13`. ROT-x is an algorithm which rotates the alphabet characters by x steps. For example, encrpyting `abc` with ROT-2 gives us `cde`.

We don't have to decrypt the flag by hand because there are a lot of online tools that can do the job for us.

Let's decrypt the flag using [this site](https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher)

Copy the encrypted flag in the first box, Roatations to use: `13` and we will get: `PICOCTFNOTTOOBADOFAPROBLEM`. Fix the flag by adding `{`, `}` and `_` in the right places, and using small letters.

## Final Answer

`picoCTF{not_too_bad_of_a_problem}`

## Approach & Solution

Let's visit the website. There are a bunch of Irish actors with names and images, nothing helpful at all. On the upper left corner there is a menu, let's check out the pages.
In the `Support` page, there is nothing that can help us login, just a bunch of questions and answers. In the `Admin Login` page however, there is a login form.
Let's try random input: `Username:asd` and `Password:asd`. Notice that we got redirected from `/login.html` to `/login.php`, so it is fairly possible that the form is checking the username and password with a SQL statement similar to: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='asd' AND password='asd'`.

Let's try to inject a payload with the `admin` username:

Let's try the simple payload: `admin'--` in the username field(no password needed to be entered). Boom! Here is the flag: `picoCTF{s0m3_SQL_c218b685}`


## Final Answer

`picoCTF{s0m3_SQL_c218b685}`

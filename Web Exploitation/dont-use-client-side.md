> Never trust the client


## Approach & Solution

Let's check the website. It's a portal that checks for a unique password, guessing the password obviously won't work.
Let's inspect the `verify` button on this page by mouse right-clicking on it and then pressing `inspect`. As you can see, there is an `event handler function` called `verify()` that is called when clicking on the button, let's check out the function, maybe the password is there!

Steps to get the flag:

1. Inspect the page by pressing `F12`.
2. Expand the `script` tags because the `verify()` function is a javascript function and is implemented in-between `script` tags.
3. Locate the `verify()` function:

Here it is:

```
  function verify() {
    checkpass = document.getElementById("pass").value;
    split = 4;
    if (checkpass.substring(0, split) == 'pico') {
      if (checkpass.substring(split*6, split*7) == '706c') {
        if (checkpass.substring(split, split*2) == 'CTF{') {
         if (checkpass.substring(split*4, split*5) == 'ts_p') {
          if (checkpass.substring(split*3, split*4) == 'lien') {
            if (checkpass.substring(split*5, split*6) == 'lz_b') {
              if (checkpass.substring(split*2, split*3) == 'no_c') {
                if (checkpass.substring(split*7, split*8) == '5}') {
                  alert("Password Verified")
                  }
                }
              }
      
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    else {
      alert("Incorrect password");
    }
    
  }
```

4. As you can conclude from reading the function, the password is splitted into parts, form the password from the splitted parts and you will get: `picoCTF{no_clients_plz_b706c5}`


## Final Answer

`picoCTF{no_clients_plz_b706c5}`

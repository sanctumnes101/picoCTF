## Description

> This website can be rendered only by picobrowser, go and catch the flag! https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/28921/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:28921
 

## Hints

> You don't need to download a new web browser
 

## Approach & Solution

Let's check out the website. There is a button called `Flag`. Let's hit the button. Oops! an error message appears saying: `You're not picobrowser...`. It seems like we have to click the button from picobrowser, but the hint says that there is no download needed.

The solution is to trick the website into thinking that we're using it from a different browser than the actual one. This is called `User Agent Spoofing`.

To spoof the user agent, follow these steps for `chrome` browser:

1. Press `F12` to inspect the website in the `Description`.
2. Click on the 3 dots in the right upper corner, then click on `more tools`, then `network conditions`.
3. Uncheck the `Select Automatically` option from the `User Agent` header, and write down `picobrowser` in the custom field. 
4. Click on the flag, and it will appear: `picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_84f9c865}`


## Final Answer

`picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_84f9c865}`

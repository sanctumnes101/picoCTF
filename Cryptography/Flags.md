## Description

> What do the flags mean?


## Hints

> The flag is in the format PICOCTF{}


## approach & Solution

Let's download the image of the flags. Ok so obviously these are NOT country flags, so what are they? I googled "white flag with red square", went to images, clicked on the flag that matches the flag in the given image, and got a list of [Nautical flags](http://www.beaufortonline.com/nautical-flag-guide/).

The site: https://pixy.org/1214843/

Let's decrypt the flag using the site above. I could decrypt most of the characters, but some flags are not there! So I refered to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Signals), and in the sources, I found a link to [Naval Flag Signaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_flag_signalling), and there i could decrypt the rest of the letters.


## Final Answer

`PICOCTF{F1AG5AND5TUFF}`

## Description

> The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44573/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:44573


## Hints

> Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?


## Approach & Solution

The description says that the factory is hiding something from it's users. The type of users who can edit the website and hide things from users are `admin` users.
The hint says that there is no password check for users other than Joe. Let's try that. Login with a random username and password. For this demonstration I'll logon as `Username: asd`, `Password: asd`.

Once you login, you'll notice that you're redirected to a page called `/flag`, and there is a message in green that says: `Success: You logged in! Not sure you'll be able to see the flag though.` and another message in black that says: `No flag for you`. It seems like the flag is on this page, but it's hidden for the users as the description says, but what if we logged in as an **admin**?
There is a password check only for the username `Joe` so it makes sense that `Joe` is the username of the admin. But we don't know the password, and if we try random passwords it won't work, so we'll have to find another solution.

Notice that we're able to login as any user other than `Joe`, so maybe we can upgrade our priviledges somehow? While we're logged in, let's check the [cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) and try to change them!

Steps to get the flag:

1. Login with a username **other than** `Joe` and a random password.
2. Press `F12` to inspect elements.
3. Go to `Application` tab, and scroll down for the `Cookies` category in `Storage`.
4. Expand the cookies and double click the cookie stored for the website.
5. You'll notice that there is a header called `admin` and has a value of `False`, change it to `True`.
6. Refresh the page and you'll get the flag: `picoCTF{th3_c0nsp1r4cy_l1v3s_0c98aacc}`


## Final Answer

`picoCTF{th3_c0nsp1r4cy_l1v3s_0c98aacc}`

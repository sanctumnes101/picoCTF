## Description

> Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/9670/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:9670


## Hints

> How do you inspect web code on a browser?
> There's 3 parts


## Approach & Solution

By looking at the challenge title and the first hint, it is obvious that we need to `inspect-element` the website in the `Description`. 
So let's inspect-element the website by pressing `F12`. Now let's expand everything. Notice that there's an `HTML comment` saying: `<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->`. The second hint says that there are 3 parts, so it seems like the first part of the flag is `picoCTF{tru3_d3`.
Now, it seems like we've hit a wall, but not really! if you press on `How` in the homepage, it says that the website is made using `html`,`css`, and `javascript`. So let's head to `Sources` in the inspect-element tab.
There is a folder called "Problem/9670" which is our challenge, and it contains 2 files. Let's inspect `mycss.css`. In the end of the file, there is a comment saying: `/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */`, and here we found the second part: `t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t`.
The rest is obvious, we'll inspect `myjs.js` and read the comment in the end of file: `/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?2e7b23e3} */`, and here we found the third part: `_lucky?2e7b23e3}`.


## Final Answer

`picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?2e7b23e3}`

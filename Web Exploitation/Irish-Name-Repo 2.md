## Description

> There is a website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/52849/ (link). Someone has bypassed the login before, and now it's being strengthened. Try to see if you can still login! or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:52849


## Hints

> The password is being filtered.


## Approach & Solution

This is a follow-up to the `Irish-Name-Repo 1` challenge. The hint says that the password is being filtered, but in the previous challenge we didn't enter a payload in the password field, so let's try to perform the same steps.

Steps to try:

1. Go to the website, and then go to the `Admin Login` page using the menu on the upper left corner.
2. Enter the following payload in the `username` field: `admin'--` and leave the password blank

Boom! here is the flag: `picoCTF{m0R3_SQL_plz_fa983901}`


## Final Answer

`picoCTF{m0R3_SQL_plz_fa983901}`

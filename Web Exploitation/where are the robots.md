## Description

> Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:56830


## Hints

> What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?


## Approach & Solution

If we head to the website, it's a seemingly 1 page website because there are no buttons and if you inspect the page there is nothing hidden. Though, there is a message in the homepage of this website saying: `Where are the robots?`. Usually websites contain a text file called `robots.txt`, and it is used to hide pages of the websites from visitors of the websites and from search engines, so for example if my website is `example.com` and i listed `example.com/example` in `robots.txt`, it won't appear in search engines even if the keywords of the search match the content of this page.
Let's check if this file exists by heading to: `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/robots.txt`. As expected, it does exist! 
Notice that the `disallow` header contains: `/1bb4c.html`, so this page - that is supposed to be hidden - is found. Let's check it out!
Go to: `jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830//1bb4c.html`. There is the flag: `picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_1bb4c}`.


## Final Answer

`picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_1bb4c}`
